# Moving to GItHub! #

I've started work on a new version of Google Hacks! Please star the new project to get updates:

https://github.com/octalmage/googlehacks

## Description ##

Google Hacks is a compilation of carefully crafted Google searches that expose novel functionality from Google's search and map services. For example, you can use it to view a timeline of your search results, view a map, search for music, search for books, and perform many other specific kinds of searches. You can also use this program to use google as a proxy.

The name should not imply the way it should be used.

Hacks is meant as this definition.

"A Hack is a modification of a program or device to give the user access to features otherwise were unavailable to them. " Taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_%28technology%29).

Please do not use this program for illegal uses.

If you have used this program to find a vulnerability or if your domain is being taken advantage of, we suggest you use [Google Hacks Honey Pot](http://ghh.sourceforge.net/userfaq.php)

What im hoping by releasing this program is that it will help crack down on illegal and illegally distributed copyrighted material.
